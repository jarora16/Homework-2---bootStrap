# Homework-2---bootStrap

For this assingment we were required to create a responsive webstie with an Index, Portfolio, and contact page which can be accessed from the navigation bar. 

I coded and designed this website as if my client was a photogrpaher and need a website to show case his work. 
I formatted the porfolio page with a loose grid to show case 12 images in an easy to view layout.
Also included a about me page with a small paraparagh describing the photographer and an image in the a box in the middle of the page. (Using the container class, to style this)
Lastestly, I included a message board for any potential clients to reach out throught the website.
